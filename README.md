# Introduction
This is a simple package created to facilitate the final work for the SIN5026 class. The main idea is to compare
the solution provided on the paper [Usage of a genetic algorithm for optimizing stock usage](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3377929.3398159)
with a solution based on Integral Linear Programing, using gurobi.
